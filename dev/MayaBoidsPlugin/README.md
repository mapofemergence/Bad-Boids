Notes
--------------

The Bad Boids plugin uses the library MayaBoids.dll, you will need it to be properly installed, in order for the plugin to work.
MayaBoids.dll relies, in its turn, on the code from Maya Cache DLL Project; though, such code is embedded, and you won't need to install further libraries.
