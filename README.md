Bad Boids
==============

_Bad Boids_ is a research initiative by 100cells (Costanzo D'Angelis, Stefano Cieri).

Note
--------------
The KDTree folder contains files from John Tsiombikas' library.
We suggest you to refer directly to the [kdtree project page](http://code.google.com/p/kdtree) for anything pertaining to that.

Documentation
--------------

No real documentation still exists, by now; we're working on a new version which we'll document as soon as possible.
The project page will be [here](http://blog.100cells.com/bad-boids).
